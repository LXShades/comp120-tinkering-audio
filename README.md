## Contract 2 - Sound Effect Generation

You are currently been tasked with creating a tool which will generate sound
effects, the target for these sounds in an 8-bit style game. You have to generate
a pickup, jump, death and laser.

## User Manual

This simple tool can be used to create basic sounds. Use the sliders to change the properties of the sound, and the Play button to preview it. The Save button can be used to save your sound as a .wav file when you are finished.  

Using the preset sound buttons will automatically move the sliders to create the preset sounds.  

What do the sliders do you ask? Easy, they change the colour of your sound! More yello, red, white, blue and purpleness!
No. We won't be serious. We are being creative.

(Not that the green slider will be overridden if the white slider is greater than 0)

## Requirements

* **Generate Sounds** Generate four sounds. Pickup, jump, death and laser.
* **Select sound to generate** Choose which type of sound you want.
* **Listen to Sound** Hear a preview before saving the sound.
* **Save Sounds** Save the generated sound to file.

## Stretch Goals

* **Customise sounds** Choose custom settings to alter the sounds* Super stretch goal 1: **Basic filters and controls**
* Super stretch goal 2: **Curves/line graphs** to affect the values of a filter over time.
## Additional stretch goals (old uncomitted version for review)
* **Advanced customisation for lasers:** e.g. laser has a charge up stage and firing stage and optional effects e.g. echo and distortion
* **Advanced customisation for jump:** Sound length, start/end volume
* **Advanced customisation

## Technical notes

* **Potential sound types** Sine wave, saw wave, square wave, more?
* **Potential filters types** Pitch, volume, clip, combine, reverse, more?

## Plan of action!!!

* Add a user interface  
* Basic window  
* Button to save sound  
* Add sliders to adjust volume, frequency and number of echoes  
* Twist! Sliders are all done in colours. For creatvity   
* Small colour box to show the colour of the sound

## Added Bonus Stuff!

* Funny reactions to your colours
* Image and pseudo random text
